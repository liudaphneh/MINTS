# MINTS: Multiple Imputation of Nonlinear hierarchical Time Series data

enrollmentfull_MINTS.R contains code to reproduce the multiple imputation results for Net Enrollment Rate using the MINTS method from https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01872

Estimates of secondary school enrollment rates were obtained from the World Bank DataBank and downloaded on August 5, 2021. The series downloaded were SE.SEC.NENR for the Net Enrollment Rate and SE.SEC.ENRR for the Gross Enrollment Ratio. These estimates are reproduced in ner_ger_no_regions_20210805.csv and in the "NER_observed" and "GER_observed" columns of secondary_enrollment_completed_40.csv and secondary_enrollment_imputed_median.csv.
